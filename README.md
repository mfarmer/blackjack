Blackjack_Ruby
==============

A basic Ruby implementation of the Blackjack card game as a text-based console application. There's still refactoring to do in the main.rb and a few bugs to clean up, but is otherwise a basic functional Blackjack game. I intend to add more rules such as splits, insurance, doubling down, etc. in future updates.
